Connect the cables
==================

In this step, we will connect all the cables to the Pick-it processor.
Note that all the ports on the back of the Pick-it processor are
correctly labeled. See the image below for an overview of all necessary
connections. Follow the steps below to connect the processor:

-  Connect the processor to the power outlet with the provided cable.
-  Connect the Pick-it camera with the 10m USB cable (CBL-USB-CAM-10)
   and plug it into the CAMERA labeled USB port at the back side of the
   Pick-it processor. When the Pick-it camera is connected correctly, a
   continuous green light is lit on front of the Pick-it camera.

-  Connect the green 5m UTP network cable (CBL-CAT6-GREEN-5) from your
