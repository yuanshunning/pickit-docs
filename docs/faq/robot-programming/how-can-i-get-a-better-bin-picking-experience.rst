How can I get a better bin picking experience?
==============================================

This article covers a number of tips and tricks for improving the **bin
picking** experience with Pickit. Some of the tips are specific to
Pickit, while others relate to your hardware setup.

-  Use the :ref:`region-of-interest` box to represent the
   bin.

-  If picking from a **big bin**, consider using a **robot-mounted
   camera** and attach the ROI box to the :ref:`attaching-the-region-of-interest-to-robot-base`.
   A big bin is one whose volume is larger than the camera field of
   view, e.g. very wide, or very deep.
-  When emptying **deep bins** with a robot-mounted camera, **move the
   camera capture pose down** as the bin empties. Keeping the distance
   between camera and objects relatively short produces higher quality
   image captures.

-  In bin picking, each Pickit detection request typically yields
   multiple objects. Select an **object ordering strategy** that places
   higher objects first. In general prefer highest product center over
   highest product part. In the image below object 1 will be picked
   before object 2.

-  Enable :ref:`checking collisions <check-collision-with>`
   between tool and bin, and between tool and other objects in the bin.

-  :ref:`enforce-alignment-of-pick-frame-orientation`
   to constrain the approach direction and orientation. When enforcing
   alignment constraints it's useful to enable the bin avoidance
   strategy to improve reachability of objects close to the bin borders.
-  Consider adding an :ref:`detect-empty-roi`
   when no more detections are found.
-  Not related to Pickit but to bin picking in general, use a **slender
   tool** **that is as long as the bin depth**. Leaving bulky parts of
   the tool and the robot outside of the bin at all times greatly
   improves object reachability. This is not always a feasible
   alternative due to application constraints, so it's a good idea to
   consider in early stages of application development.
