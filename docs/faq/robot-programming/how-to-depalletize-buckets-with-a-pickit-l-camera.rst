How to depalletize buckets with a Pickit L camera
=================================================

In this article, we explain step by step how to set up an application
for unloading buckets from a euro pallet using Pickit with a `Pickit
L
camera <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PolmzgreM0RNcAzXhGkgD8IeyU2aCDOA/view>`__.
If you're already curious to see the end result, here's

The goal of this application is to automate depalletizing five layers of
buckets. Each layer contains 15 buckets, and there is a rectangular
cardboard separating the layers. The robot should pick all buckets in
each layer, one by one, and place them on a conveyor belt. Once the
layer is empty, the robot should pick the cardboard and place it on the
side.

In this example, a large 4 degrees of freedom depalletizing robotic arm,
equipped with a vacuum gripper, is used for the picking. The gripper is
composed of four suction cups.

Mount the camera on the robot flange
------------------------------------

In this application, the camera is mounted to the robot flange. This
way, the robot can bring the camera lower to make sure that the buckets
are always in the field of view of the camera, as the layers of buckets
are emptied.

In this stage, it is useful to have the Pickit web interface opened,
showing the 2D view. This provides immediate visual feedback of the
effectiveness of the camera mounting.

For this application, we choose to have a tilted camera mount to make
sure that the gripper does not occlude the field of view.

You should make sure that the highest layer of the pallet is at least
1300 mm away from the camera. In case the robot cannot bring the camera
sufficiently high to achieve this, the following solutions are possible:

-  Fix the camera such that it lies at a higher position than the
   flange.
-  Put the robot base at a higher position than the pallet.

Robot camera calibration
------------------------

Once the camera is mounted to the robot flange, robot-camera calibration
should be carried out. Refer to :ref:`robot-camera-calibration`
for further guidance.

Teach the region of interest
----------------------------

We recommend teaching the region of interest fixed to the robot base,
and not to the camera.

Before continuing, make sure there is a connection between Pickit and
the robot.

For teaching the region of interest, use the L markers. Place the
markers at three corners of the empty pallet or on the floor, and define
a :ref:`region-of-interest`.

Using the arrows in the 3D view of the web interface, adjust the region
of interest, such that its height fits the whole loaded pallet. The
region of interest should be wide enough to fit the pallet and tolerate
uncertainties in the pallet positioning. It should not include external
elements standing close by, which are not supposed to be detected
(walls, fences, other machines, ...).

For depalletizing applications like this, we recommend using the 
:ref:`Dynamic-box-based-roi-filter`,
which can be activated in the **Region of interest** page, in the
**Advanced ROI filters** tab. This filter makes sure that all objects in
the top layer will be detected and picked before any objects in the next
layer. For this application we set a threshold of 150 mm, i.e. we keep
the top 150 mm of the point cloud and filter out everything below.

Configure the products
----------------------

In this application, we will detect the buckets and intermediate
cardboard layers as two separate products. Refer to the general
detection tutorials.

Buckets product
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This product should allow detecting aligned touching circles. Pickit
Pattern is recommended for this type of applications. Since the circles
are touching, the circle contours cannot be seen completely. Tune the 
:ref:`contour score <Explaining-the-pattern-detection-parameters>`
threshold parameter to a lower value to detect more buckets, but don't
set it too low to make sure that no circles are detected on the empty
cardboard. The picking strategy can be such that buckets are picked in
order, for instance, from left to right.

Cardboard product
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This product should be configured in a way that the cardboard is always
detected. This can be achieved using Pickit Flex rectangles, with a
flexible range of dimensions and low contour and surface scores.

Make a robot program
--------------------

The robot should pick the buckets and place them on a conveyor belt,
while the current highest layer is not empty. Once the layer is empty,
the robot should pick the piece of cardboard and drop it on the side.

In order to keep cycle time short, the robot can trigger a detection and
pick all detected buckets, one after the other. After the last detected
bucket is picked, the robot should trigger a new detection for buckets,
until no buckets are detected anymore.

.. hint:: Run a number of consecutive detections in the robot program to
   be sure that no buckets are left on a certain layer.

At this point, the robot program should trigger a detection for the
cardboard, pick it and drop it by the side. This finishes the top layer,
leaving the buckets of the next layer ready for detection.

Start picking!
--------------

Once the robot program is finished, you are ready to pick! In the first
attempt, ensure a safe experience: let the robot move slowly and in
manual mode. Here's a

that you just completed.
