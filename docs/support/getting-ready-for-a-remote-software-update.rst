Getting ready for a remote software update
==========================================

To receive an update of the Pickit software, your Pickit processor
needs to be connected to the Internet:

-  The preferred method is to connect your Pickit processor via an
   Ethernet cable. 
-  If this is not possible you can connect your Pickit processor via
   the 3G USB dongle.

Connecting via Ethernet cable
-----------------------------

#. **Plug in an Ethernet cable** (with Internet access) into the **LAN
   port** of the Pickit processor.
#. Navigate to the **Network settings**, by clicking on the Settings
   button at the top-right of the web interface.

#. In the **Pickit port labeled 'LAN’** section, make sure that the
   **IP address** field has a valid value (blue arrow in the image
   below).

If an **IP address** shows up, you are good to go. A Pickit engineer
can now connect to your system.

If no **IP address** shows up:

-  Double check if the Ethernet cable is attached in the right
   way to the Pickit processor and your network;
-  Check with your system administrator if there is a **firewall** on
   your network. If so:

   -  Ask your system administrator to whitelist the ‘LAN’ port’s **MAC
      address** shown in the Network page. (red arrow in the image
      above)
   -  Ask your system administrator to open **TCP 443 port.**

.. note:: Pickit uses VPN/TLS over TCP port 443 to establish a
   connection. The Pickit software update server is known as
   **vpn.intermodalics.eu**.

Connecting via USB dongle
-------------------------

Your Pickit system was delivered with a USB 3G dongle to connect the
Pickit system to the Internet when connecting via
Ethernet is not an option. A Pickit SIM card is already
inside so this works out of the box. 

.. note:: Since this is a wireless device, it's important that it is
   positioned **outside a metal enclosure** (cage of Faraday). In case your
   Pickit system is in such an enclosure, you may use an extension cable
   up to 2m to install the remote service modem outside this enclosure.

.. note:: Depending on **3G reception on site**, a Pickit support
   engineer could view and manipulate the Pickit web interface, install
   product and or setup files and perform updates. If the mobile reception
   is bad viewing and manipulating the interface could be impossible. On
   slow connections, software updates can take up to several hours.

Pickit systems were shipped with 2 different types of USB 3G dongles,
use the images below as a reference to check which type of dongle came
with your Pickit system.

Type 1
~~~~~~

The USB dongle can be plugged into any available USB port of your
Pickit system. No configuration is required.

| Solid red        | The modem is initializing.                                                                                                      |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Blinking red     | Check if a SIM/USIM card is inserted. If it is, try to unplug and replug the modem.                                             |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Blinking green   | The card has registered to the network but no Internet connection could be made.                                                |
|                  | Try reinserting the USB modem and restarting the Pickit processor. If that doesn’t help, contact a Pickit support engineer.     |
+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Solid Green      | The network is available with a successful Internet connection. A Pickit support engineer can now access the system.            |
