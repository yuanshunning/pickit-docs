Installing the Pickit calibration plate
========================================

To  **accurately pick** objects located by Pickit, a robot
camera \ **calibration is needed**. Different methods of calibration are
described in the article :ref:`robot-camera-calibration`.

Pickit provides the necessary equipment for mounting the calibration
plate on two types of flanges, namely robots with 50 mm (ISO
9409-1-50-4-M6) and 31,5 mm (ISO 9409-1-31.5-4-M5) wide flanges.

Preparation
-----------

Fit the aluminum fitting piece in the biggest hole of the plate so that
the fitting piece sticks out at the coloured side of the calibration
plate.

-  For 50 mm flanges use the biggest fitting piece and biggest 6 mm
   dowel pin
-  For 31,5 mm flanges use the smallest fitting piece and smallest 5 mm
   dowel pin

Align the dowel pin in the only diagonal hole and smack it with a soft
hammer, so that it enters the plate.

Installing the Pickit calibration plate on a tool changer
----------------------------------------------------------

It is also possible to mount the calibration plate to the robot flange
by using a tool changer.

Fit the aluminum fitting piece in the biggest hole of the plate so that
the fitting piece sticks out at the coloured side of the calibration
plate.

-  For 50 mm flanges use the biggest fitting piece and biggest 6 mm
   dowel pin
-  For 31,5 mm flanges use the smallest fitting piece and smallest 5 mm
   dowel pin

Align the dowel pin in the only diagonal hole.

Bolt the tool changer piece to the plate and attach the plate to the
tool changer.
