Mount the camera
================

In this step, we will mount the Pickit camera. Thanks to the L-bracket
and ball joints, the camera can be mounted on a wide variety of
structures. Follow these simple steps below to mount the camera:

-  Unbox the camera
-  Use the L-bracket to mount the camera 700mm above a flat surface.
   (1700mm for a Pickit L-camera)
-  Use the ball joints to point the camera towards the
   surface.
